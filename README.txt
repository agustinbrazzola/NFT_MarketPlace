NFT - MarketPlace  

This is a prototype of a NFT-MarketPlace where there's two contracts:  

NFT: Which is the contract that creates the NFTs itself. A user can mint NFT's and they will be listed on the marketplace contract.
Marketplace: Here is where you can buy and sell NFTs, keep track of the sold NFTs and your own NFTs.  

This is using hardhat console and openZeppelin libraries.
