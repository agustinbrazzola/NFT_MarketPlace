NFT - MarketPlace  

This is a prototype of a NFT-MarketPlace where there's two contracts:  

NFT: Which is the contract that creates the NFTs itself. A user can mint NFT's and they will go to a market place.  

Marketplace: Here is where you can buy, sell and keep track of the sold NFTs and also keep track of your own NFTs.  

This is using hardhat console and openZeppelin libraries.
